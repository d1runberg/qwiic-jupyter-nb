    "The SparkFun Qwiic Twist is a digital RGB rotary encoder breakout that is also able to connect to our Qwiic Connect System. The Twist takes care of all the various interrupts, switches, PWM'ing of LEDs, and presents all those features over an easy-to-use I2C interface. The Qwiic Twist was designed to get rid of the large mass of wires that are needed to implement an RGB encoder in a breadboard enabling you to stop messing around with interrupt debugging and get back to your project! Utilizing our handy Qwiic system, no soldering is required to connect it to the rest of your system. However, we still have broken out 0.1\"-spaced pins in case you prefer to use a breadboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "One rotation in the clockwise direction for the rotary encoder increases the overall count by 24 and -24 in the counter-clockwise direction. The number of 'ticks' or steps you have turned the knob are all transmitted over I2C. The red, green, and blue LEDs are all set via software commands and can be digitally mixed to achieve over 16 million colors!"

    "Hooking up the Qwiic Twist with our Qwiic Line of products that are supported with Python are pretty straight forward! You need a Phat or our Qwiic Shim, your Qwiic Twist and a Qwiic Cable. The cables are keyed so there is no way to plug things in backwards. Qwiic is also daisy chain-able so if you want to add another Qwiic compatible boards later you just need a cable and find an open Qwiic connector on your system! \n"
