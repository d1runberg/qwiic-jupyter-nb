    "\n",
    "The SparkFun Servo pHAT for Raspberry Pi allows your Raspberry Pi to control up to 16 servo motors in a straightforward and uncomplicated manner via an I2C connection. Thanks to its I2C capabilities, this PWM HAT saves the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, allowing you to use them for other purposes. The Servo pHAT also adds a serial terminal connection, which will allow you to bring up a Raspberry Pi without having to hook it up to a monitor and keyboard. We have provided a Qwiic connector for easy interfacing with the I2C bus using the Qwiic system, and a 4-pin header specifically for connecting to the Sphero RVR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Power to the SparkFun Servo pHAT can be supplied through USB-C connector. This will power either the servo motors only, or power the servo motors as well as the Raspberry Pi that is connected to the HAT. We switched to USB-C to allow you to bring more current to your servos than ever before. This USB-C connector can also be used to hook up the Pi via serial port connection to avoid having to use a monitor and keyboard for setting up the Pi. To supply power only to the servo power rail (and not the Pi's 5V power rail), you just need to cut a small trace on the isolation jumper. Doing this allows you to drive heavier loads coming from multiple or larger servos. We've even added power protection circuits to the design, to avoid damage to power sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of this pHAT's 16 servo motor pin headers has been spaced out to the standard 3-pin servo pinout (ground, 5V, signal) to make it easier to attach your servo motors."

    "# Qwiic Hookup\n",
    "Hookup with our Qwiic Line of products that are supported with Python are pretty straight forward! This board is a Qwiic Phat which means that hook up is as simple as attaching it to the GPIO header on your Jetson Nano Development Kit as shown in the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Servo Phat has a Qwiic connector on it to add any of of our other Qwiic boards that are supported with Python. But, it also serves a primary purpose of connecting and controller servos with your Nvidia Jetson Nano. The board has the potential to hookup 16 different servos, each having their own channel. A USB C type connector is included to provide an external power supply for powering the servos seperately from the Jetson Nano (which can also be powered from this power source as well). Servos can be attached as shown below\n",

Next, a quick test of our servo attached to channel 0 to make sure is connected and working on our system, if not, your servo will not move! Finally, if we are all good and clear we start the keypad with its `.begin()` method. "
