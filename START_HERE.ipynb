    "The SparkFun qwiic python package aggregates all python qwiic drivers/modules to provide a single entity for qwiic within a python environment. The qwiic package delivers the high-level functionality needed to dynamically discover connected qwiic devices and construct their associated driver object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Python Support\n",
    "\n",
    "SparkFun currently supports Python drivers for over 20 different Qwiic boards and we are adding more as time goes on. For the most up-to-date list of supported boards check the driver listing on our Github repo [here](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py/tree/master/qwiic/drivers).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each qwiic board has an independent driver library that implements the required logic for the specific board. This driver implementation is structured as a python package that supports standard python package management operations and tools. Additionally, each driver is deployed in a distinct GitHub repository which provides a central area for package management and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide dynamic discovery and instantiation capabilities, the qwiic package imports all the underlying qwiic driver packages at runtime. As such the qwiic driver packages must be installed prior to using this package. These packages can be installed manually, or the overall package will install them automatically when using a PyPi based package manger (aka pip).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependent Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To make development and evaluation easer, the modules this package is dependent on are included in this repository as git submodules. This allows rapid checkout and access to the entire qwiic python ecosystem if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure has the following layout:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Qwiic_Py/\n",

    "   +--- qwiic_i2c/                                   --> Link to the qwiic_i2c submodule repository\n",

    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyPi Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "his repository is hosted on PyPi as the sparkfun-qwiic package. On systems that support PyPi installation via pip, this package is installed using the following commands For all users (note: the user must have sudo privileges):\n",
    "`sudo pip install sparkfun-qwiic`\n",
    "\n",
    "For the current user:\n",
    "`pip install sparkfun-qwiic`\n",
    "\n",
    "This process will also install all modules the qwiic package requires for operation, including the needed qwiic driver packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install, make sure the setuptools package is installed on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct installation at the command line:\n",
    "`python setup.py install`\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a package for use with pip:\n",
    "`python setup.py sdist`\n",
    "\n",
    "A package file is built and placed in a subdirectory called dist. This package file can be installed using pip:\n",
    "`cd dist`\n",
    "`pip install sparkfun_qwiic_-<version>.tar.gz`\n"
