    "The SparkFun CCS811/BME280 Environmental Combo Breakout takes care of all your atmospheric-quality sensing needs with the popular CCS811 and BME280 ICs. This unique breakout provides a variety of environmental data, including barometric pressure, humidity, temperature, TVOCs and equivalent CO2 (or eCO2) levels. To make it even easier to use this breakout, all communication is enacted exclusively via I2C, utilizing our handy Qwiic system. "

    "Hookup with our Qwiic Line of products that are supported with Python are pretty straight forward! You need a Phat or our Qwiic Shim, your Qwiic board you Qwiic Environmental Board and a Qwiic Cable. The cables are keyed so there is no way to plug things in backwards. Qwiic is also daisy chain-able so if you want to add another Qwiic compatible boards later you just need a cable and find an open Qwiic connector on your system! "

    "To use the Qwiic Environmental Combo in Python and your Nvidia Jetson Nano, you first need to install the required Python libraries for it. If you haven't done so yet; no worries!

    "\n",
    "Once everything is installed we import the libraries into our program. Note that the Environmental Combo board is a mash-up of two sensors, so we import libraries for both the BME280 (`qwiic_bme280`) and the CCS811(`qwiic_ccs811`). We also include the `time` library as well as `sys`"
