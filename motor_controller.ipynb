    "The SparkFun Qwiic Motor Driver takes all the great features of the Serial Controlled Motor Driver (SCMD) and miniaturizes them, adding Qwiic ports for plug and play functionality. Boasting the same 4245 PSOC and 2-channel motor ports as the SCMD, the SparkFun Qwiic Motor Driver is designed to communicate over I2C to make setting up your next robotic project as fast and easy as possible! Utilizing our handy Qwiic system and screw terminals for motor and power hook-up, no soldering is required to connect it to the rest of your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "With 1.2A steady state drive per channel (1.5A peak) and 127 levels of DC drive strength, this little Qwiic board is perfect for your small DC motor driver needs. Since the Qwiic Motor Driver is a 3.3V logic device, you'll need to use a logic level converter to interface to 5V."

    "Hooking up the Qwiic Motor Driver with our Qwiic Line of products that are supported with Python are pretty straight forward, but there is a little more than just a Qwiic plug here! You need a Phat or our Qwiic Shim, your Qwiic Twist and a Qwiic Cable and a power source designated for powering your motors. Most single board computers and microcontroller boards do not source enough current to safely power motors. We provide a pair of screw terminals for you to add an external power supply for your motors. A few of our Phats work perfectly for pairing with the motor driver with this in mind.\n",

In fact, this is the Phat that our version of the Jetbot uses to power its motors. **Note: This sources power through the 5V pin on the Single Board Computer and has its current limits. Using larger motors may draw too much current and brown out your system. \n",
